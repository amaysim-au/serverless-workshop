# amaysim Serverless Workshop

This workshop covers how software is being developed at amaysim. You will be building a Todo application using Serverless, Docker, and ReactJS in AWS.

## Topics

This workshop has 3 parts: Serverless, Docker and Pipelines, and JAM stack. Each of them has 2 branches: initial and a final. The goal for you is to complete each part from the initial branch and validate your solution against the final branch.

### Serverless

The back-end of the Todo app. It uses AWS, Serverless, Lambda, and NodeJS. The 2 branches are:

- serverless/initial
- serverless/final

### Docker and Pipeline

From local development to CI/CD pipelines using Docker, Docker Compose, Make. The 2 branches are:

- docker_pipeline/initial
- docker_pipeline/final

### JAM Stack

Front-end of the Todo app using the JAM Stack (ReactJS, S3). The 2 branches are:

- jam/initial
- jam/final

## Prerequisites

Each part of the workshop relies on the following prerequisites:

- AWS account with admin access (including development keys)
- [assume-role](https://github.com/remind101/assume-role)

> Each branch will also have their own prerequisites describe in their README.
